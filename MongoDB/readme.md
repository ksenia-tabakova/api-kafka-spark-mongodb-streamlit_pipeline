## MongoDB in brief

MongoDB-express was set to run as container (see [docker-compose file](https://github.com/ksenia-tabakova/api-kafka-spark-mongodb-streamlit_pipeline/blob/main/MongoDB/docker-compose-kafka-spark-api-mongodb.yml)).

I created database "fmi" and collection "measurements" via web-interface.

I test tested with Postman whether data is correctly recorded to the database.
