## Streamlit in brief

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is fun and fast way to build web app for data visualization.
I didn't invest much time into studying in detail various abilities of Streamlit and built very simple interactive dashboard, where user is selected Station and parameter of of interest and simple line chart plotted with pyplot is displayed. 

[Python script](https://github.com/ksenia-tabakova/api-kafka-spark-mongodb-streamlit_pipeline/blob/main/Streamlit/streamlit-app.py)
